### Description 

Radio fm is a plugin to run a radio station's website. 

It was base on the a plugin i saw (but now depreciated), this plugin is more like a re-invented version of the said plugin.

1. Added new functions to it.
2. Updated the codebase according to Php and wordpress standard.
3. Touch-up the interface to look a lot more appealling 
4. And I'll be making continuos changing to it.


The plugin includes the ability to associate users with "shows" (schedulable blocks of time that contain a description, and other meta information), and generate playlists
associated with those shows.  The plugin contains a widget to display the currently on-air DJ with a link to the DJ's show and current playlist.  A schedule of all show can also be generated.

1. Upload plugin .zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and unzip.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
